# Make your wbsite bombproof

In earlier posts, we walked through
[setting up a website](hosting.html),
[getting a domain name](hosting2.html), and
[doing some basic security hardening](hosting3.html).
But there are still a lot of events that can break a website.
A denial-of-service attack, a really dedicated hacker gaining access,
a hosting service that decides to shut down your server, a major
infrastructure outage, or a natural disaster.



To misquote a line from the movie Contact, Why build one when you can build
three and thrice the cost?
