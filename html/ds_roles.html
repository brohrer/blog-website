I became a data scientist in 2013 when the title was young.
It was so new that most companies had no idea what a data scientist should
be doing, only that they desperately needed one or they would be left behind.
Sound familiar?

<p>
Initially organizations expected data scientists to spin straw into gold&mdash;to transform
unorganized data archives into profit. Big Data, it was believed,
held inherent value, which only needed to be coaxed into cash form.
This rarely panned out, so the
approach evolved into a) data scientists produce "insights" and then
b) "insights" generate profit. This also proved elusive in the end.
Eventually data scientists settled into various niches involving
<em>answering questions using data</em>, and some companies decided they didn't
need as many data scientists as they had originally thought.
</p>

<p>
Then came the Neural Network revolution, where the machine learning
hammer of choice became the convolutional neural network and many
problems got recast as an image recognition problem. The software
engineering, data engineering, and operations engineering that production
CNNs required merited the job title of Machine Learning Engineer.
Image recognition became synonymous with "modern machine learning".
A data scientist's job description got blurry. Did it include ML
Engineering as a subset? Should a good data scientist candidate have
CNN experience? Every team took their own stance. No consensus emerged.
</p>

<p>
Then the spotlight abruptly shifted to Transformers and Large Language Models.
With their massive scale, the engineering and operations requirements
increased yet again. Only a small handful of enterprises are even
capable of training such a model, and they accomplish this only with
an army of engineers and an unfathomable amount of specialized computing
power. LLMs are effectively black boxes. Their structure is known but their
vast collection of parameters makes their behavior unpredictable and
inexplicable. Using them is a matter of API calls, rather than
training and evaluation. Most importantly, they are generative, rather than inductive. They
don't actually answer questions, they create answer-looking things that
are correct often enough to lull us into complacency.
</p>

<p>
LLMs are far enough removed from a core data scientist's skillset that
their care and feeding isn't part of the data science job description.
But they can still have a big effect on a data scientist's day.
(More on that below.)
</p>

<p>
The next hot new trend has not yet emerged, but if the historical 5 year cycle
holds true, it's due any day now.
</p>

<p>
On the pre-history side, data science has existed by other names
for a very long time. After all,
people have been answering questions using data for thousands of years.
